Vote Types
==========

**Vote Types** are used to define how voting will work during your shows.

.. _vote-type-intervals:

Intervals
---------

**Intervals** allow you to initiate votes at certain minute markers during your show.
If *"Manual Interval Control"* is selected (the preferred approach), the "tech" person in control decides when to
hit the **Start Vote** button to begin the next voting interval.


**Example**
  Intervals must begin with the 0 minute. Each comma separated number after that represents a minute.
  For example 0,2,7 would have a voting interval begin at zero minutes, then the **Vote Type** timer on the
  **Show Controls** page will show 2 minutes until the next interval (the time between 0 and 2 minutes),
  and then the **Show Controls** page will show 5 minutes until the next interval (the time between 2 and 7 minutes).

.. _vote-styles:


Vote Styles
-----------

Each **Vote Type** requires a *Vote Style* that defines how the vote should appear during the show.
There are *six* different voting styles to choose from.

Player Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Player Options** voting randomly selects a player and a list of suggestions for audience members
to vote on for that player.


**Example**
  We'll use a "Character Title" :ref:`suggestion-pools-start` and allow audience members to decide what
  the name of the selected player's character will be.

Options
~~~~~~~

**Options** voting randomly selects a list of suggestions for the audience to vote on.


**Example**
  We'll use a "Locations" :ref:`suggestion-pools-start` and allow audience members to decide what
  the name of the selected player's character will be.

Pre-show Voted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Repeatable Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Repeatable Options** voting means that suggestions voted as the winner aren't
removed from the suggestion pool when they win. You can **repeatedly** vote on the same options over and over.


**Example**
  We typically use this paired with an *Admin Suggestions Only* :ref:`suggestion-pools-start` as a simple "Test" vote
  to get the audience used to the voting portion of the app before we start the show.
