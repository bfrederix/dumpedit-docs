Player
======

**Players** represent the cast in your improv show. You can add or edit **Players** and choose what **Players** will
appear in each improv show at the time you create the :ref:`shows-start`.

.. note::
  **Players** must be marked as active to appear on the :ref:`shows-start` creation page. **Players** cannot be deleted
  due to their appearance in :ref:`show-recaps-start` (we recommend repurposing them as a different cast member instead).
