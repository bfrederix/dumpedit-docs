Suggestion Pool Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Suggestion Pool** *Description* appears on the suggestion page of your channel when a
show is created and is important because it informs the audience on what type of suggestions
you want for your show. So if the **Suggestion Pool** was "Character Titles", you might ask that
users enter an adjective and a noun such as "The lonely programmer".
