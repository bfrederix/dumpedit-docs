Channel
=======

**Channels** are the hub for your shows. Here you can create or edit :ref:`shows-start`s, :ref:`suggestion-pools-start`s,
:ref:`vote-types-start`s, :ref:`players-start`s, and even export user e-mails that have signed in at your shows.
**Channels** are where you access the :ref:`shows-controller` to direct the show's voting and the
:ref:`shows-display` which is used to display the voting and voting results to the audience. **Channels** are also what
your audience interacts with on their mobile browsers to login, enter suggestions, and vote.
