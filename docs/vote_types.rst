Vote Types
==========

**Vote Types** are used to define how voting will work during your shows.
**Vote Types**:
* Can have *Intervals* that allow you to initiate votes at certain minute markers during your show.

Vote Styles
-----------

| Each **Vote Type** requires a *Vote Style* that defines how the vote should appear during the show.
There are *six* different voting styles to choose from.

Repeatable Options Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| **Repeatable Options Style** voting means that suggestions voted as the winner aren't
removed from the suggestion pool when they win. You can **repeatedly** vote on the same options over and over.

| We typically use this paired with an *Admin Suggestions Only* **Suggestion Pool** as a simple "Test" vote
to get the audience used to the voting portion of the app before we start the show.
